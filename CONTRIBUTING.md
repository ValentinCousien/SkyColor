- Use descriptive names for internal functions
- Maintain clean separation of concerns

### Testing
- Add tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests continue to pass
- Test both happy path and error conditions
- Use meaningful test names that describe the behavior being tested

### Documentation
- Update README.md for new features
- Add code examples for new public APIs
- Update CHANGELOG.md following semantic versioning
- Include docstrings for complex algorithms
